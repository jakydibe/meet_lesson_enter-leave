# meet_lesson_enter-leave
a simple script which automatically enters a google meet lesson at the time you desire and leaves it (if u want so) when the number of partecipants goes below a number of your choiche


for now i only used italian language, but if someone would like to use it i translate ez

to run this script you need to install the requirements.txt and be sure chromedriver.exe is in the same path of the .py file
